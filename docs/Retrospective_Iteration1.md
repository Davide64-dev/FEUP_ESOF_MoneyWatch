## Retrospective Iteration 1

### What we should do differently:
- Give a more accurate value to the effort of each step
- Estimate more accurately the time it takes to implement each user story

### What we did right:
- We were persistent, even though we had a few complications (mainly in the database implementation) we didnÂ´t give up
